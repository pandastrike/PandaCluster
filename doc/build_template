Usage: pandacluster build-template [OPTIONS]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Follow any command with "help" for more information.

This function pulls an official AWS CloudFormation template from the CoreOS's
public S3 bucket and customizes it according to your specifications.  This
template is used to configure the cluster to your needs.

Required:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional:
  -c  CoreOS "Channel". (Default = "stable")  CoreOS provides rolling updates
        across a three-tier stability scheme.  "stable" contains a version that
        has been through extensive battle-testing and debugging, while "beta"
        and "alpha" contain newer features and dependency versions.

        Allowed values: "stable", "beta", "alpha"

  -p  Path for the final AWS CloudFormation template file, containing a JSON string.
        The path is relative to your working directory and includes the filename.
        By default, the file is placed into your working directory under the
        filename template.json.

  -v  Virtualization Type. (Default = "pv").  Amazon offers two types of
        virtualization, Para-Virtualization (PV) and and Hardware-assisted
        Virtual Machine (HVM).  In short, PV has better performance, but HVM is
        more stable.

        Allowed Values: "pv", "hvm"

  -u  Path for the unit configuration file. (Default = null)  This file is a CSON
        object that holds relevant CoreOS unit configuration data.  The path is
        relative to your working directory and includes the filename.
