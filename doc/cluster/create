Usage: panda-cluster cluster create [arg...]
-----------------------------------------------
Follow any command with "help" for more information.

Panda-Cluster is built around a Cluster-App-Microservice (CAM) model for deployment,
allowing it to understand and gracefully manipulate clusters running in your AWS account.

"cluster create" generates a cluster of CoreOS machines using your AWS account.
Each comes equipped with a private DNS and sidekick support servers.

Required:
  -d  (public_domain) The name of the public hosted zone that routes the Internet to your cluster.
        You must own this domain.

  -n  (cluster_name)  Name of cluster. Alpha-numeric string of at most 255 characters.

  -k  (key_pair) Name of SSH keypair.  Access to the cluster is achieved via an SSH
        connection.  The public key with this name is placed onto every CoreOS
        machine.  *If there is no key with this name present in your AWS account,
        you are alerted and the process fails.

  -p  (private_domain) The name of the private hosted zone that routes internally.
        This is only seen on the cluster an may be any value.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional:
  -c  (channel)  The CoreOS channel that gets loaded in the instance. (Default = "stable")
        There are three channels, where "stable" is the most battle tested, and
        "alpha" is the most advanced.

        Allowed Values:
        "alpha", "beta", "stable"

  -i  (instance_type)  Instance type on EC2. (Default = "m3.medium")  All machines in the cluster
        are of the same type.

        Allowed Values:
        "c1.medium", "c1.xlarge",
        "c3.large", "c3.xlarge", "c3.2xlarge", "c3.4xlarge",
        "m1.medium", "m1.large", "m1.xlarge",
        "m2.xlarge", "m2.2xlarge", "m2.4xlarge",
        "m3.large", "m3.xlarge", "m3.2xlarge"

  -m (formation_service_templates)  This activates CoreOS services that request additional, ephmeral
       storage for your instances.  The Docker host is mounted to this drive, giving your containers
       more disk space.  The amount of space you have depends on the instance size.  See Amazon
       documentation for more details

  -o  (spot_price)  This is the upper limit you are willing to pay for an EC2 spot instance. When
       prices rise above this value, your instance is terminated.  However, it is possible to
       utilize instances for up to 90% cheaper than guaranteed instances.  Great for testing.

  -r  (region) AWS Region.  Your default region is set with the your AWS credentials, but you
        may temporarily override that region for this command.

        Allowed Values: "ap-northeast-1", "ap-southeast-1", "ap-southeast-2",
        "eu-central-1", "eu-west-1", "sa-east-1", "us-east-1", "us-west-1",
        "us-west-2"

  -s  (cluster_size) Size of cluster. (Default = 3) Clusters must have between 3 and 12
        machines, inclusive.

  -v  (virtualization)  The type of virtualization to use in your instance. (Default = "pv").
        There are two types, para-virtualization (pv) is more common and has better performance,
        however hardware virtual machine (hvm) is more reliable.

        Allowed Values:
        "pv", "hvm"
