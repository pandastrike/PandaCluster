Usage: panda-cluster cluster create [arg...]
-----------------------------------------------
Follow any command with "help" for more information.

Panda-Cluster is built around a Cluster-App-Microservice (CAM) model for deployment,
allowing it to understand and gracefully manipulate clusters running in your AWS account.

"cluster create" generates a cluster of CoreOS machines using your AWS account.
Each comes equipped with a private DNS and sidekick support servers.

Configuration details may be provided either via the huxley.cson manifest file
or flags on the command line.

Required:
  -d  (public_domain) The name of the public hosted zone that routes the Internet to your cluster.
        You must own this domain.

  -n  (cluster_name)  Name of cluster. Alpha-numeric string of at most 255 characters.

  -k  (key_pair) Name of SSH keypair.  Access to the cluster is achieved via an SSH
        connection.  The public key with this name is placed onto every CoreOS
        machine.  *If there is no key with this name present in your AWS account,
        you are alerted and the process fails.

  -p  (private_domain) The name of the private hosted zone that routes internally.
        This is only seen on the cluster an may be any value.
