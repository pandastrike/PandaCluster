Usage: pandacluster create [Options] -k KEY_PAIR -n CLUSTER_NAME
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Follow any command with "help" for more information.

Spins up a CoreOS cluster on Amazon's EC2 cloud service according to several
specified options.  (Options with [*] are not yet available)

Required:
  -n  Name of cluster. Alpha-numeric string of at most 255 characters.

  -k  Name of SSH keypair.  Access to the cluster is achieved via an SSH
        connection.  The public key with this name is placed onto every CoreOS
        machine.  *If there is no key with this name present in your AWS account,
        you will be presented with the opportunity to create one, and the
        private will be downloaded to your working directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional:
  *-c  CoreOS Channel. (Default = "stable")  CoreOS offers three "channels" of its
        operating system. "stable" contains a version that has been through
        extensive battle-testing and debuging, while "beta" and "alpha" contain
        newer features and dependency versions.

        Allowed values: "stable", "beta", "alpha"

  *-m  Size of additional ephemeral storage, in GB. (Default = 0)  CoreOS uses
        Docker containers to run most applications and these containers can
        sometimes consume a large amount of hard drive space.  This will create
        the cluster with additional space on each machine for the partition
        containing the Docker host.

  *-r  AWS Region.  Your default region is set in the PandaCluster dotfile, but you
        may temporarily override that region for this command.

  -s  Size of cluster. (Default = 3) Clusters must have between 3 and 12
        machines, inclusive.

  -t  Type of EC2 instance. (Default = "m3.medium")  All machines in the cluster
        are of the same type. You may select between the following EC2 instance
        types:
        "c1.medium", "c1.xlarge",
        "c3.large", "c3.xlarge", "c3.2xlarge", "c3.4xlarge", "c3.8xlarge",
        "hi1.4xlarge", "hs1.8xlarge",
        "m1.medium", "m1.large", "m1.xlarge",
        "m2.xlarge", "m2.2xlarge", "m2.4xlarge",
        "m3.medium", "m3.large", "m3.xlarge", "m3.2xlarge",
        "t1.micro"

  *-u  Upload additional public keys. (Default = null)  If you would like to
        grant cluster access to multiple users without passing your private key
        around, you may place these users' public keys on each machine of the
        CoreOS cluster when the cluster is created.

        This flag takes a CSON file that contains an array of public keys:

        public_keys:[
          "key1",
          "key2",
          "key3"
        ]

  *-v  Virtualization Type. (Default = "pv").  Amazon offers two types of
        virtualization, para-virtualization (PV) and and hardware-assisted virtual
        machine (HVM).  In short, PV has better performance, but HVM is more stable.

        Allowed Values: "pv", "hvm"
